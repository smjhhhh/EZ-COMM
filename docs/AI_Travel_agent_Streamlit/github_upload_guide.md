# 📤 Step-by-Step GitHub Upload Guide

## 🔑 Before You Start

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never upload your API keys to GitHub!**

Make sure your `.env` file is NOT uploaded (it's in `.gitignore` for protection).

## 📁 Step 1: Prepare Your Files

Create these files in your project folder:

```
your-project-folder/
├── Assignment.ipynb          # Your existing notebook
├── README.md                 # Copy from the artifact above
├── requirements.txt          # Copy from the artifact above  
├── .gitignore               # Copy from the artifact above
└── .env                     # Your API keys (KEEP LOCAL ONLY)
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)**
2. **Click "New" or "+"** in the top right
3. **Choose "New repository"**
4. **Fill in details:**
   - Repository name: `ai-travel-agent` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `AI Travel Agent & Expense Planner with LangChain and OpenAI`
   - ✅ Public (so you can share it in the form)
   - ✅ Add a README file (we'll replace it)
   - ❌ Don't add .gitignore (we have our own)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## 💻 Step 3: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

### Option A: Drag & Drop Upload

1. **Go to your new repository on GitHub**
2. **Click "uploading an existing file"**
3. **Drag and drop ALL files EXCEPT `.env`:**
   - `Assignment.ipynb`
   - `README.md` 
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `.gitignore`
4. **Add commit message:** `Initial commit: AI Travel Agent implementation`
5. **Click "Commit changes"**

### Option B: File by File Upload

1. **Click "Add file" → "Create new file"**
2. **For each file:**
   - Name it correctly (e.g., `README.md`)
   - Copy-paste the content from artifacts above
   - Click "Commit new file"

## 🔧 Step 4: Upload Your Notebook

1. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
2. **Drag your `Assignment.ipynb` file**
3. **Commit with message:** `Add travel agent notebook implementation`

## ✅ Step 5: Verify Upload

Your repository should now have:
- ✅ `README.md` - Project description
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies  
- ✅ `Assignment.ipynb` - Your notebook
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Protection for sensitive files
- ❌ `.env` - Should NOT be visible (protected by .gitignore)

## 🔗 Step 6: Get Your GitHub Link

Copy your repository URL. It will look like:
```
https://github.com/your-username/ai-travel-agent
```

## 📝 Step 7: Submit to Assignment Form

Use this link in the assignment submission form:
[https://forms.gle/g8RZ4qx8yvNcih4B7](https://forms.gle/g8RZ4qx8yvNcih4B7)

## 🚨 Security Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] No `.env` file visible in repository
- [ ] No API keys visible in any files
- [ ] `.gitignore` is present and working
- [ ] README explains how to set up API keys
- [ ] All features work as demonstrated

## 🛠️ Alternative: Command Line Upload

If you prefer using Git commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd your-project-folder

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files (except those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Travel Agent implementation"

# Add remote (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ai-travel-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your AI Travel Agent is now live on GitHub and ready for submission! 

**Remember to test that others can:**
1. Clone your repository
2. Set up their own API keys in `.env`
3. Run your notebook successfully
